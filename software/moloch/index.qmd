Moloch is a modern, minimalist Beamer theme for LaTeX presentations that
emphasizes clean typography and readability. Inspired by the metropolis theme,
it offers extensive customization options while maintaining a professional,
uncluttered aesthetic suitable for academic and technical presentations.

The theme includes built-in support for progress bars, section slides, and
multiple color schemes, with careful attention to typographic details and
spacing. It's designed to work seamlessly with modern LaTeX distributions and
integrates well with common presentation workflows. Visit
