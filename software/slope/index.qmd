SLOPE (Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation) is a regularization method for
high-dimensional regression that controls the false discovery rate while
performing variable selection. Unlike LASSO which uses a single penalty
parameter, SLOPE uses a sequence of sorted penalties that provide better
statistical properties for multiple testing scenarios.

This package provides efficient, production-ready implementations across R,
Python, and Julia, with a unified C++ core for performance. It includes support
for generalized linear models, sparse matrices, and modern optimization
algorithms, making it suitable for large-scale statistical learning problems in
genomics, econometrics, and machine learning.
