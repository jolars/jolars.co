  Area-proportional Euler diagrams with ellipses.
citation:
  abstract: |
    Euler diagrams are common and user-friendly visualizations for set
    relationships. Most Euler diagrams use circles, but circles do not always
    yield accurate diagrams. A promising alternative is ellipses, which, in
    theory, enable accurate diagrams for a wider range of input. Elliptical
    diagrams, however, have not yet been implemented for more than three sets or
    three-set diagrams where there are disjoint or subset relationships. The aim
    of this paper is to present eulerr: a software package for elliptical Euler
    diagrams for, in theory, any number of sets. It fits Euler diagrams using
    numerical optimization and exact-area algorithms through a two-step
    procedure, first generating an initial layout using pairwise relationships
    and then finalizing this layout using all set relationships.

    A case study in fitting area-proportional Euler diagrams with ellipses using
    eulerr
---

eulerr creates area-proportional Euler diagrams using ellipses instead of just
circles. While most Euler diagram software is limited to circles (which often
can't accurately represent set relationships), eulerr uses numerical
optimization to fit ellipses that can represent a wider range of set
intersections accurately.

The package handles any number of sets and automatically finds the best layout
using a two-step procedure: first generating an initial layout from pairwise
relationships, then optimizing using all set relationships simultaneously. It's
ideal for visualizing overlapping categories in genomics, survey data, or any
domain where set relationships need clear visual representation.
