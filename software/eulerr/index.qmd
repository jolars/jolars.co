  Area-proportional Euler diagrams with ellipses.
citation:
  abstract: |
    Euler diagrams are common and user-friendly visualizations for set
    relationships. Most Euler diagrams use circles, but circles do not always
    yield accurate diagrams. A promising alternative is ellipses, which, in
    theory, enable accurate diagrams for a wider range of input. Elliptical
    diagrams, however, have not yet been implemented for more than three sets or
    three-set diagrams where there are disjoint or subset relationships. The aim
    of this paper is to present eulerr: a software package for elliptical Euler
    diagrams for, in theory, any number of sets. It fits Euler diagrams using
    numerical optimization and exact-area algorithms through a two-step
    procedure, first generating an initial layout using pairwise relationships
    and then finalizing this layout using all set relationships.
