  abstract: |
    Numerical validation is at the core of machine learning research as it
    allows to assess the actual impact of new methods, and to confirm the
    agreement between theory and practice. Yet, the rapid development of the
    field poses several challenges: researchers are confronted with a profusion
    of methods to compare, limited transparency and consensus on best practices,
    as well as tedious re-implementation work. As a result, validation is often
    very partial, which can lead to wrong conclusions that slow down the
    progress of research. We propose Benchopt, a collaborative framework to
    automate, reproduce and publish optimization benchmarks in machine learning
    across programming languages and hardware architectures. Benchopt simplifies
    benchmarking for the community by providing an off-the-shelf tool for
    running, sharing and extending experiments. To demonstrate its broad
    usability, we showcase benchmarks on three standard learning tasks:
    $\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression, Lasso, and ResNet18 training for
    image classification. These benchmarks highlight key practical findings that
    give a more nuanced view of the state-of-the-art for these problems, showing
    that for practical evaluation, the devil is in the details. We hope that
    Benchopt will foster collaborative work in the community hence improving the
    reproducibility of research findings.
