Tomat is a lightweight Pomodoro timer for the command line, designed
specifically for integration with status bars like
[waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) and
[polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) Written in Rust for minimal
resource usage and fast startup, it runs as a daemon that can be controlled
through simple commands.

The tool provides configurable work/break intervals, desktop notifications,
sound alerts, and outputs formatted status information that can be piped
directly into status bars.
