Unfortunately, there\nis a jungle of Pomodoro timers out there, and finding a good one has proven\nhard. Before I turned to window managers like i3 and sway,^[Which is what I am\ncurrently using.] I used the [GNOME Pomodoro\nTimer](https://gnomepomodoro.org/), which I liked. But ever since I switched\nfrom GNOME, I've been struggling to find a good replacement.\n\nWhat I have been looking for, specifically, is a Pomodoro timer\nthat integrates with my status bar (currently waybar) and that\nI can control using either keyboard shortcuts or mouse clicks.\n\nThere are alternatives that can be used for this problem,\nsuch as\n\n- [waybar-pomodoro-timer](https://github.com/Andeskjerf/waybar-module-pomodoro),\n- [Tomato.C](https://github.com/gabrielzschmitz/Tomato.C),\n- [potato-c](https://github.com/nimaaskarian/potato-c),\n- [waybar-timer](https://github.com/jbirnick/waybar-timer), and\n- [uair](https://github.com/metent/uair).\n\nEach of these are great projects, and yet none of them ever\nquite fit my use case. So I decided to write my own\nPomodoro timer, which I named **Tomat** (Swedish 🇸🇪 for tomato).\n\nThe main goal of Tomato is to create a simple Pomodoro timer that's\neasy to use and configure and that easily integrates with status bars\nlike waybar. It roughly follows the GNU Philosophy of \"Do One Thing\nWell\", and does not try to be a full-fledged time management\napplication. It also tries to be as lightweight as possible,\nwithout unnecessary dependencies, and is written in Rust (which helps).\n\nTomat is designed as a client--server application, where the server\nruns in the background and keeps track of the timer state, while\nthe client is used to interact with the server, e.g., to start\nor stop the timer, or to query the current status. This design\nmakes it easy to integrate Tomat with status bars, as the status\nbar can simply call the client to get the current status.\n\nSetup is a little more involved than a simple one-binary\napplication, but the design makes it easier to handle\npersistent state and to interact with multiple clients and\nto handle notifications and sounds.\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| fig-cap: A high-level overview of the Tomat architecture.\n%%| fig-align: center\ngraph TD\n    A[Client] -->|Commands| B(Server)\n    B -->|Status| A\n    B -->|Notifications| C[Notification System] \n    B -->|Sound| D[Sound System]    \n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\nTomat is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tomat),\nso if you have Rust and Cargo installed, installing it is\nas simple as running:\n\n```bash\ncargo install tomat\n```\n\nTo then get going, we need to first start the server:\n\n```{bash}\ntomat daemon start\n```\n\n",
