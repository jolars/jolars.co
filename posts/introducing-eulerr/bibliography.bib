  abstract = {Variable selection can be challenging, particularly in situations with a large number of predictors with possibly high correlations, such as gene expression data. In this article, a new method called the OSCAR (octagonal shrinkage and clustering algorithm for regression) is proposed to simultaneously select variables while grouping them into predictive clusters. In addition to improving prediction accuracy and interpretation, these resulting groups can then be investigated further to discover what contributes to the group having a similar behavior. The technique is based on penalized least squares with a geometrically intuitive penalty function that shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero. Additionally, this penalty yields exact equality of some coefficients, encouraging correlated predictors that have a similar effect on the response to form predictive clusters represented by a single coefficient. The proposed procedure is shown to compare favorably to the existing shrinkage and variable selection techniques in terms of both prediction error and model complexity, while yielding the additional grouping information.},

These formulas give much better fits for experimental data based on small colour differences than does CIELAB. None of these has an associated uniform colour space (UCS). The need for a UCS is demonstrated by the widespread use of the a*b* diagram despite the lack of uniformity. This article describes the development of formulas, with the same basic structure as the DIN99 formula, that predict the experimental data sets better than do the CMC and CIE94 colour-difference formulas and only slightly worse than CIEDE2000 (which was optimized on the experimental data).

In the classical settings when p (the number of predictors) and q (the number of predictors with non-zero coefficients in the true linear model) are fixed, Yuan and Lin (2007) give a necessary and sufficient condition for the Elastic Net to consistently select the true model. They showed that it consistently selects the true model if and only if there exist suitable sequences λ1 (n) and λ2 (n) that satisfy EIC (which is defined later in the paper). Here we study the general case when p, q, and n all go to infinity. For general scalings of p, q, and n, when gaussian noise is assumed, sufficient conditions are given such that EIC guarantees the Elastic Net's model selection consistency. We show that to make these conditions hold, n should grow at a rate faster than qlog(p - q). We compare the variable selection performance of the Elastic Net with that of the Lasso. Through theoretical results find simulation studies, we provide insights into when the Elastic Net can consistently select the true model even when the Lasso cannot. We also point out through examples that when the Lasso cannot select the true model, it is very likely that the Elastic Net cannot select the true model either.},

  abstract = {There is a broad consensus on the coupling of deteriorating gait and vestibular asymmetry, which has proved predictive of falls in the elderly. To date, research on this coupling remains inconclusive and has not focused specifically on fallers. In the present study, differences in gait variability were examined in a population of elderly females with fall-related wrist fractures, divided into samples with positive (N=28, 73±9 years) and negative head-shaking tests (N=6, 67±9 years). Swing, stance, and double support time variability were measured in preferred speed walking using GAITRite(®) and statistically evaluated in multivariate analysis of covariance with age as covariate. Results showed overall greater gait variability for the positive nystagmus group (p=0.03) despite non-significant adjustment of the covariate (p=0.18). In post-hoc analysis, the effect on variability in double support time emerged as a significant and large contributor to this difference (p=0.009, ηp(2)=0.20). Conversely, the ability of swing and stance time variability to discriminate between groups was both non-significant and small (p=0.25, ηp(2)=0.04 and p=0.34, ηp(2)=0.03 respectively). We believe that the increased variability might stem from a strategic use of double support to re-stabilize from balance perturbations during gait. To some extent, these results diverge from previous findings and need to be reassessed in future studies.},

  abstract = {Background: There are diverging results on the efficacy of exercise as treatment for patients with persistent neck pain. Development of new treatment strategies is warranted, especially on methods that could lead to lasting reductions in pain, disability, and improvements in function. Objective: In a collaboration between the Department of Pain Rehabilitation at Skåne University Hospital and the two orofacial pain departments of Umeå and Malmö University, we have developed a supervised exercise intervention program aimed at alleviating pain, disability, and improving self-efficacy in patients with persistent neck pain. Methods: Patients with persistent neck pain undergoing rehabilitation at the Physiotherapy Program at the Department of Pain Rehabilitation, Skåne University Hospital will receive a supervised, structured program of exercises addressing postural control and functions of the neck, jaw, and shoulders – all of which will feature structured progressions. The exercise program will complement the customized therapy that all patients currently receive. The intervention is in part based on an ongoing project in Umeå for patients with jaw-related pain, which has resulted in positive outcomes for, not only jaw pain, but also neck pain. In the present project, the program has been extended and optimized for patients with persistent neck pain. Results The gym was designed in 2015 and the pilot study started in May 2016. After evaluation of the pilot study, necessary adjustments will be carried out before the main study commences (planned to start in 2017). The preliminary results have so far have been promising. Conclusions: The SMIL gym is a supervised and structured exercise program for patients with persistent neck pain. Patients will exercise in a gym-like environment under supervision of trained physiotherapists to promote individualized and sustainable progression.}

  abstract = {Vestibular asymmetry is a common cause of dizziness in the elderly, for whom it precipitates the risk of falling. Previous studies have shown that those with vestibular asymmetry displayed an altered variability in double support time (DST) compared to controls. However, swing time (SwT) variability findings are conflicting. In this study, we investigated if vestibular asymmetry might be causally connected to increased DST variability. We studied a group of eight elderly fallers with wrist fractures across three months, during which time four of them regained vestibular symmetry while four others developed an asymmetry. We evaluated the variability of DST and SwT, both when the participants suffered from vestibular asymmetry and when they did not. On average, variability in DST was significantly greater by 2.38~\%CV (coefficient of variation) when participants scored positive for vestibular asymmetry compared to when not, t(5) = 4.39, p = 0.01, ξ = 1.67. In contrast, SwT variability differed non-significantly by 0.44~\%CV when participants had tested positive versus negative for vestibular asymmetry, t(5) = −0.87, p = 0.39, ξ = −0.29. As a possible rationale for our results, we propose that increased DST variability may be the result of a re-stabilization strategy. Further research on DST variability and its correlation to the duration of vestibular asymmetry is recommended.}

  abstract = {AIM OF INVESTIGATION: Those who fail to recover from whiplash traumas risk persistent, widespread pain. Women and those whose trauma was long ago may be particularly prone to develop such symptoms, but research on the topic is so far scant. We aimed to assess whether age, gender, or time since trauma was related to widespread pain. METHODS: 746 patients with persistent pain after whiplash traumas were recruited, and included based on reported trauma and ICD-10 codes M53.0, M53.1, S13.4, or T91.8A. The exclusion criterion was major neurodegenerative diseases, which excluded one person. Pain distribution was diagnosed clinically as widespread, regional, or local. A multinomial logit was fit to the data, predicting pain distribution from age, gender, and time since trauma. RESULTS: The model fit was significant Chi-2(3) = 37.8, p {$<$} 0.0001 Women were 1.595 [CI: 1.138; 2.232] times more likely to be diagnosed with widespread than local pain p {$<$} 0.000, and 2.710 [CI: 1.656; 4.425] times more prone to have widespread compared with regional pain p = 0.027. Every month passed since the trauma increased the risk for widespread pain with 1.003 [CI: 1.001; 1.006] times compared with local pain, p = 0.027, and 1.005 times [CI: 1.001; 1.009] compared with regional pain, p = 0.011. Age did not account for any significant differences. CONCLUSION: Time elapsed since the trauma correlated with widespread pain---a novel finding. In our discussion we provide a rationale for this, along with the increased risk of being a woman, which confirms the results of previous studies.},

  abstract = {Euler diagrams are common and intuitive visualizations for data involving sets and relationships thereof. Compared to Venn diagrams, Euler diagrams do not require all set relationships to be present and may therefore be area-proportional also with subset or disjoint relationships in the input. Most Euler diagrams use circles, but circles do not always support accurate diagrams. A promising alternative for Euler diagrams is ellipses, which enable accurate diagrams for a wider range of set combinations. Ellipses, however, have not yet been implemented for more than three sets or three-set diagrams where there are disjoint or subset relationships. The aim of this thesis is to present a method and software for elliptical Euler diagrams for any number of sets. In this thesis, we provide and outline an R-based implementation called eulerr. It fits Euler diagrams using numerical optimization and exact-area algorithms through two steps: first, an initial layout is formed using the sets' pairwise relationships; second, this layout is finalized taking all the sets' intersections into account. Finally, we compare eulerr with other software implementations of Euler diagrams and show that the package is overall both more consistent and accurate as well as faster for up to seven sets compared to the other R-packages. eulerr perfectly reproduces samples of circular Euler diagrams as well as three-set diagrams with ellipses, but performs suboptimally with elliptical diagrams of more than three sets. eulerr also outperforms the other software tested in this thesis in fitting Euler diagrams to set configurations that might lack exact solutions provided that we use ellipses; eulerr's circular diagrams, meanwhile, fit better on all accounts save for the diagError metric in the case of three-set diagrams.},

PEDro was searched for RCTs in physical therapy published between January 1 2015 and December 5 2016. For each trial, the first and last authors’ affiliations and the PEDro scale were extracted. Using the first and last authors’ affiliations, each article was geocoded using the Data Science Toolkit API. The search located 2,959 RCTs, which were affiliated primarily with a small cluster of countries. The median PEDro score for all trials was 5 (IQR 4:7). The geographical spread of the RCTs was focused around Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Oceania, the United States, and parts of South America. The lack of diversity might be problematic for the research field, even though the average clinical trial in physical therapy is of fair quality.},

  abstract = {Backgrounds and aims: A significant proportion of patients who do not recover after whiplash trauma are reported to have increased sensitivity to pain. We aimed to investigatethe impact of age, gender, and type of trauma on pain distribution in patients with persisting symptoms after whiplash trauma, referred to and assessed at a pain rehabilitation clinic in specialized neck pain teams. Methods: Data on age, gender, type of trauma, and pain distribution were collected from the medical records of 745 consecutive patients with persistent pain after whiplash trauma from 2010 to 2014. The data had beenrecorded in a prospective manner according to a pre-established checklist. Paindistribution was diagnosed clinically in consensus as widespread, regional, or local. The data on age and gender distributions were compared to a previous study of acute whiplash trauma in the same geographic area from 2007 and 2008. Results: Age and type of trauma did not seem to affect the paindistribution. However a shift in age and gender distribution wasobserved from the acute to the chronic stage towards higher age and higher proportionsof women. Widespread pain was more common in females, but the difference wasless than expected. Conclusions: Widespread pain is common in patients who do notrecover after whiplash trauma. Females were overrepresented in the chronicstage and the question is if the higher propensity to develop widespread paincould explain this or if the altered gender distribution has its explanation indifferent reactions to the initial trauma.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To analyze a cohort of 745 consecutive patients referred to a regional specialist clinic for evaluation of post-traumatic neck pain during a five-year period. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study of baseline assessments performed by multi-professional rehabilitation teams according to a standardized checklist. Results: The cohort contained nearly twice as many females as males (64\% versus 36\%). The type of injury did not differ between sexes. Of the entire cohort, 38\% were diagnosed with widespread pain, 50\% with regional pain, and 12\% with local pain. The pain distribution among the females was 43\% widespread, 48\% regional, and 9\% local, and corresponding figures among males were 29\%, 53\%, and 18\%. Longer time between trauma and assessment did not affect pain distribution among the men, but a tendency towards more widespread pain was observed among the women. Discussion: The importance of "female sex" as risk factor for the development of persistent pain after neck trauma needs to be discussed further. The high frequency of regional and widespread pain among patients with persistent neck pain after trauma calls for both multidisciplinary assessments and treatment strategies. The relationships between different pain distribution patterns, disability, activity, and psychological factors need to be studied further.},

  abstract = {In mathematics, physics and engineering, the cardinal sine function or sinc function, denoted by sinc(x), has two slightly different definitions. In mathematics, the historical unnormalized sinc function is defined for x ≠ 0 by                        sinc         ⁡         (         x         )         =                                                sin               ⁡               (               x               )                          x                                       .                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash operatorname \{sinc\} (x)=\{\textbackslash frac \{\textbackslash sin(x)\}\{x\}\}\textasciitilde.\}    In digital signal processing and information theory, the normalized sinc function is commonly defined for x ≠ 0 by                        sinc         ⁡         (         x         )         =                                                sin               ⁡               (               π               x               )                                         π               x                                                    .                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash operatorname \{sinc\} (x)=\{\textbackslash frac \{\textbackslash sin(\textbackslash pi x)\}\{\textbackslash pi x\}\}\textasciitilde.\}    In either case, the value at x = 0 is defined to be the limiting value sinc(0) = 1. The normalization causes the definite integral of the function over the real numbers to equal 1 (whereas the same integral of the unnormalized sinc function has a value of π). As a further useful property, all of the zeros of the normalized sinc function are integer values of x. The normalized sinc function is the Fourier transform of the rectangular function with no scaling. It is used in the concept of reconstructing a continuous bandlimited signal from uniformly spaced samples of that signal. The only difference between the two definitions is in the scaling of the independent variable (the x-axis) by a factor of π. In both cases, the value of the function at the removable singularity at zero is understood to be the limit value 1. The sinc function is then analytic everywhere and hence an entire function. The term "sinc" /ˈsɪŋk/ is a contraction of the function's full Latin name, the sinus cardinalis (cardinal sine). It was introduced by Phillip M. Woodward in his 1952 paper "Information theory and inverse probability in telecommunication", in which he said the function "occurs so often in Fourier analysis and its applications that it does seem to merit some notation of its own", and his 1953 book "Probability and Information Theory, with Applications to Radar".},
