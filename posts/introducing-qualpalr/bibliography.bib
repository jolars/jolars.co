  abstract     = "Several colour-difference formulas such as CMC, CIE94,
                 and CIEDE2000 have been developed by modifying CIELAB.
                 These formulas give much better fits for experimental
                 data based on small colour differences than does
                 CIELAB. None of these has an associated uniform colour
                 space (UCS). The need for a UCS is demonstrated by the
                 widespread use of the a*b* diagram despite the lack of
                 uniformity. This article describes the development of
                 formulas, with the same basic structure as the DIN99
                 formula, that predict the experimental data sets better
                 than do the CMC and CIE94 colour-difference formulas
                 and only slightly worse than CIEDE2000 (which was
                 optimized on the experimental data). However, these
                 formulas all have an associated UCS. The spaces are
                 similar in form to L*a*b*. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals,
