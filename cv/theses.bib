    Euler diagrams are common and intuitive visualizations for data involving sets and
    relationships thereof. Compared to Venn diagrams, Euler diagrams do not require all
    set relationships to be present and may therefore be area-proportional also with
    subset or disjoint relationships in the input. Most Euler diagrams use circles, but
    circles do not always support accurate diagrams. A promising alternative for Euler
    diagrams is ellipses, which enable accurate diagrams for a wider range of set
    combinations. Ellipses, however, have not yet been implemented for more than three
    sets or three-set diagrams where there are disjoint or subset relationships. The
    aim of this thesis is to present a method and software for elliptical Euler
    diagrams for any number of sets. In this thesis, we provide and outline an R-based
    implementation called eulerr. It fits Euler diagrams using numerical optimization
    and exact-area algorithms through two steps: first, an initial layout is formed
    using the sets' pairwise relationships; second, this layout is finalized taking all
    the sets' intersections into account. Finally, we compare eulerr with other
    software implementations of Euler diagrams and show that the package is overall
    both more consistent and accurate as well as faster for up to seven sets compared
    to the other R-packages. eulerr perfectly reproduces samples of circular Euler
    diagrams as well as three-set diagrams with ellipses, but performs suboptimally
    with elliptical diagrams of more than three sets. eulerr also outperforms the other
    software tested in this thesis in fitting Euler diagrams to set configurations that
    might lack exact solutions provided that we use ellipses; eulerr's circular
    diagrams, meanwhile, fit better on all accounts save for the diagError metric in
    the case of three-set diagrams.
