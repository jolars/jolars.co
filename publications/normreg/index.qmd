abstract: |
  Regularized models are often sensitive to the scales of the features in the
  data and it has therefore become standard practice to normalize (center and
  scale) the features before fitting the model. But there are many different
  ways to normalize the features and the choice may have dramatic effects on
  the resulting model. In spite of this, there has so far been no research on
  this topic. In this paper, we begin to bridge this knowledge gap by studying
  normalization in the context of lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. We
  focus on normal and binary features and show that the class balances of
  binary features directly influences the regression coefficients and that this
  effect depends on the combination of normalization and regularization methods
  used. We demonstrate that this effect can be mitigated by scaling binary
  features with their variance in the case of the lasso and standard deviation
  in the case of ridge regression, but that this comes at the cost of increased
  variance. For the elastic net, we show that scaling the penalty weights,
  rather than the features, can achieve the same effect. Finally, we also
  tackle mixes of binary and normal features as well as interactions and
  provide some initial results on how to normalize features in these cases.
