abstract: |
  Numerical validation is at the core of machine learning research as it
  allows to assess the actual impact of new methods, and to confirm the
  agreement between theory and practice. Yet, the rapid development of the
  field poses several challenges: researchers are confronted with a profusion
  of methods to compare, limited transparency and consensus on best practices,
  as well as tedious re-implementation work. As a result, validation is often
  very partial, which can lead to wrong conclusions that slow down the
  progress of research. We propose Benchopt, a collaborative framework to
  automate, reproduce and publish optimization benchmarks in machine learning
  across programming languages and hardware architectures. Benchopt simplifies
  benchmarking for the community by providing an off-the-shelf tool for
  running, sharing and extending experiments. To demonstrate its broad
  usability, we showcase benchmarks on three standard learning tasks:
  $\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression, Lasso, and ResNet18 training for
  image classification. These benchmarks highlight key practical findings that
  give a more nuanced view of the state-of-the-art for these problems, showing
  that for practical evaluation, the devil is in the details. We hope that
  Benchopt will foster collaborative work in the community hence improving the
  reproducibility of research findings.
