  abstract: |
    The lasso is the most famous sparse regression and feature selection method.
    One reason for its popularity is the speed at which the underlying
    optimization problem can be solved. Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE)
    is a generalization of the lasso with appealing statistical properties. In
    spite of this, the method has not yet reached widespread interest. A major
    reason for this is that current software packages that fit SLOPE rely on
    algorithms that perform poorly in high dimensions. To tackle this issue, we
    propose a new fast algorithm to solve the SLOPE optimization problem, which
    combines proximal gradient descent and proximal coordinate descent steps. We
    provide new results on the directional derivative of the SLOPE penalty and
    its related SLOPE thresholding operator, as well as provide convergence
    guarantees for our proposed solver. In extensive benchmarks on simulated and
    real data, we show that our method outperforms a long list of competing
    algorithms.
