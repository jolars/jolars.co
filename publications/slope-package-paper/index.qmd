  We present a suite of packages in R, Python, Julia, and C++ that efficiently
  solve the Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE) problem. The packages
  feature a highly efficient hybrid coordinate descent algorithm that fits
  generalized linear models (GLMs) and supports a variety of loss functions,
  including Gaussian, binomial, Poisson, and multinomial logistic regression.
  Our implementation is designed to be fast, memory-efficient, and flexible.
  The packages support a variety of data structures (dense, sparse, and
  out-of-memory matrices) and are designed to efficiently fit the full SLOPE
  path as well as handle cross-validation of SLOPE models, including the
  relaxed SLOPE. We present examples of how to use the packages and benchmarks
  that demonstrate the performance of the packages on both real and simulated
  data and show that our packages outperform existing implementations of SLOPE
  in terms of speed.
