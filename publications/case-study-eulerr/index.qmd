  Euler diagrams are common and user-friendly visualizations for set
  relationships. Most Euler diagrams use circles, but circles do not always
  yield accurate diagrams. A promising alternative is ellipses, which, in
  theory, enable accurate diagrams for a wider range of input. Elliptical
  diagrams, however, have not yet been implemented for more than three sets or
  three-set diagrams where there are disjoint or subset relationships. The aim
  of this paper is to present eulerr: a software package for elliptical Euler
  diagrams for, in theory, any number of sets. It fits Euler diagrams using
  numerical optimization and exact-area algorithms through a two-step
  procedure, first generating an initial layout using pairwise relationships
  and then finalizing this layout using all set relationships.
