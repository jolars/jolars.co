title: "Look-Ahead Screening Rules for the Lasso"

abstract: |
  The lasso is a popular method to induce shrinkage and sparsity in the
  solution vector (coefficients) of regression problems, particularly when
  there are many predictors relative to the number of observations. Solving
  the lasso in this high-dimensional setting can, however, be computationally
  demanding. Fortunately, this demand can be alleviated via the use of
  screening rules that discard predictors prior to fitting the model, leading
  to a reduced problem to be solved. In this paper, we present a new screening
  strategy: look-ahead screening. Our method uses safe screening rules to find
  a range of penalty values for which a given predictor cannot enter the
  model, thereby screening predictors along the remainder of the path. In
  experiments we show that these look-ahead screening rules outperform the
  active warm-start version of the Gap Safe rules.
