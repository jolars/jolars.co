title: "The Hessian Screening Rule"
abstract: |
  Predictor screening rules, which discard predictors from the design matrix
  before fitting a model, have had considerable impact on the speed with which
  l1-regularized regression problems, such as the lasso, can be solved.
  Current state-of-the-art screening rules, however, have difficulties in
  dealing with highly-correlated predictors, often becoming too conservative.
  In this paper, we present a new screening rule to deal with this issue: the
  Hessian Screening Rule. The rule uses second-order information from the
  model to provide more accurate screening as well as higher-quality warm
  starts. The proposed rule outperforms all studied alternatives on data sets
  with high correlation for both l1-regularized least-squares (the lasso) and
  logistic regression. It also performs best overall on the real data sets
  that we examine.
