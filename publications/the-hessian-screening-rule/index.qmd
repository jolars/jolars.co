    Predictor screening rules, which discard predictors from the design matrix
    before fitting a model, have had considerable impact on the speed with which
    l1-regularized regression problems, such as the lasso, can be solved.
    Current state-of-the-art screening rules, however, have difficulties in
    dealing with highly-correlated predictors, often becoming too conservative.
    In this paper, we present a new screening rule to deal with this issue: the
    Hessian Screening Rule. The rule uses second-order information from the
    model to provide more accurate screening as well as higher-quality warm
    starts. The proposed rule outperforms all studied alternatives on data sets
    with high correlation for both l1-regularized least-squares (the lasso) and
    logistic regression. It also performs best overall on the real data sets
    that we examine.
