author:

abstract: |
  Qualpal is a C++ library, command-line tool, R package, and web app for
  creating qualitative color palettes with maximally distinct colors. It helps
  scientists and anyone working with data visualization choose colors that
  remain clear and accessible. Qualpal features flexible palette generation
  from multiple input formats, such as the HSL and LCHab color spaces or fixed
  sets of RGB colors, and can adapt palettes to color vision deficiencies (CVD)
  across the full dichromacy spectrum at any severity. At its core, Qualpal is
  a lightweight C++ library with no external dependencies, making it easy to
  integrate into other software and programming languages.
