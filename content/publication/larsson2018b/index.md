abstract = "In this thesis, we provide and outline an R-based implementation called eulerr. It fits Euler diagrams using numerical optimization and exact-area algorithms through two steps: first, an initial layout is formed using the sets' pairwise relationships; second, this layout is finalized taking all the sets' intersections into account. Finally, we compare eulerr with other software implementations of Euler diagrams and show that the package is overall both more consistent and accurate as well as faster for up to seven sets compared to the other R-packages. eulerr perfectly reproduces samples of circular Euler diagrams as well as three-set diagrams with ellipses, but performs suboptimally with elliptical diagrams of more than three sets. eulerr also outperforms the other software tested in this thesis in fitting Euler diagrams to set configurations that might lack exact solutions provided that we use ellipses; eulerr's circular diagrams, meanwhile, fit better on all accounts save for the diagError metric in the case of three-set diagrams."
