<p>SLOPE stands for sorted L1 penalized estimation. As the name suggests, SLOPE
is a type of <span class="math inline">\(\ell_1\)</span>-regularization. More specifically, SLOPE fits
generalized linear models regularized with the sorted <span class="math inline">\(\ell_1\)</span> norms.
But wait:
<span class="math display">\[
f(x) + h(g)
\]</span></p>
