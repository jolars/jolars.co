<p>My R package <a href="https://github.com/jolars/qualpalr">qualpalr</a> selects qualitative
colors by projecting a bunch of colors (as points) to the three-dimensional
DIN99d color space wherein the distance between any pair colors approximate
their differences in appearance. The package then tries to choose the <code>n</code>
colors so that the minimal pairwise distance among them is maximized, that is,
we want the most similar pair of colors to be as dissimilar as possible.</p>
<p>This turns out to be much less trivial that one would suspect, which posts on

and <a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/22767/choosing-a-subset-to-maximize-the-minimum-distance-between-points">Computer Science</a>
can attest to.</p>
<p>Up til now, qualpalr solved this problem with a greedy approach. If we, for instance,
want to find <code>n</code> points we did the following.</p>
<pre><code>M &lt;- Compute a distance matrix of all points in the sample
X &lt;- Select the two most distant points from M
for i = 3:n
    X(i) &lt;- Select point in M that maximize the mindistance to all points in X</code></pre>
<p>In R, this code looked like this (in two dimensions):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1)
# find n points
n &lt;- 3
mat  &lt;- matrix(runif(100), ncol = 2)

dmat &lt;- as.matrix(stats::dist(mat))
ind &lt;- integer(n)
ind[1:2] &lt;- as.vector(arrayInd(which.max(dmat), .dim = dim(dmat)))

for (i in 3:n) {
  mm &lt;- dmat[ind, -ind, drop = FALSE]
  k &lt;- which.max(mm[(1:ncol(mm) - 1) * nrow(mm) + max.col(t(-mm))])
  ind[i] &lt;- as.numeric(dimnames(mm)[[2]][k])
}

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(mat, asp = 1, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;)
plot(mat, asp = 1, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;)
points(mat[ind, ], pch = 19)
text(mat[ind, ], adj = c(0, -1.5))</code></pre>

<p>While this greedy procedure is fast and works well for large values of <code>n</code>
it is quite inefficient in the example above. It is plain to see that there are
other subsets of 3 points that would have a larger minimum distance but because
we base our selection on the previous 2 points that were selected to be
maximally distant, the algorithm has to pick a suboptimal third point. The
minimum distance in our example is 0.7641338.</p>
<p>The solution I came up with is based on a solution from
Schlomer et al. <span class="citation">@schlomer_farthest-point_2011</span> who devised of an algorithm to
partition a sets of points into subsets whilst maximizing the minimal distance.
They used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation">delaunay triangulations</a>
but I decided to simply use the distance matrix instead. The algorithm works as
follows.</p>
<pre><code>M &lt;- Compute a distance matrix of all points in the sample
S &lt;- Sample n points randomly from M
repeat
    for i = 1:n
        M    &lt;- Add S(i) back into M
        S(i) &lt;- Find point in M\S with max mindistance to any point in S
until M did not change</code></pre>
<p>Iteratively, we put one point from our candidate subset (S) back into the
original se (M) and check all distances between the points in S to those in
M to find the point with the highest minimum distance. Rinse and repeat until
we are only putting back the same points we started the loop with, which
always happens. Letâ€™s see how this works on the same data set we used above.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>r &lt;- sample.int(nrow(dmat), n)

repeat {
  r_old &lt;- r
  for (i in 1:n) {
    mm &lt;- dmat[r[-i], -r[-i], drop = FALSE]
    k &lt;- which.max(mm[(1:ncol(mm) - 1) * nrow(mm) + max.col(t(-mm))])
    r[i] &lt;- as.numeric(dimnames(mm)[[2]][k])
  }
  if (identical(r_old, r)) break
}

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(mat, asp = 1, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;)
plot(mat, asp = 1, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;)
points(mat[r, ], pch = 19)
text(mat[r, ], adj = c(0, -1.5))</code></pre>

<p>Here, we end up with a minimum distance of 0.8619587. In
qualpalr, this means that we now achieve slightly more distinct colors.</p>

<p>The newest development version of qualpalr now uses this updated algorithm which
has also been generalized and included as a new function in my R
package <a href="https://github.com/jolars/euclidr">euclidr</a> called <code>farthest_points</code>.</p>
