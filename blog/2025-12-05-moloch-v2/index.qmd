## Moloch 2.0.0 is Released!

I'm excited to announce a major update to Moloch, a minimalist Beamer
presentation theme. Version 2.0.0 brings a complete overhaul of the color system,
new themes, improved documentation, and several other refinements.

Moloch uses semantic versioning, so this major version bump indicates
that there are breaking changes. This only applies to aesthetics, however, and
all your existing presentations should still compile without issues. But do
expect some changes in appearance due to the redesigned color system, updates
to the itemize environment, and tweaks to existing themes.

## Redesigned Color System 

The biggest change in this release is a complete redesign of how colors work in
Moloch. I have become increasingly frustrated with the previous system for a couple of reasons:

- The colors of the text, its background, and the respective colors in the frame titles were
  all linked together, which for instance meant that the frame title background color had
  to be the same as the text color, which limited customization options.
- Switching between light and dark modes was toggled by `background=dark`, which both
  felt unintuitive (since it actually inverted all the colors) and also meant that the 
  colors in the primary palette had to make sense if inverted, which again limited flexibility.
- Because the light and dark switching was so basic, it meant that alert and example colors
  needed to be the same for both light and dark variants, but typically one wants to
  have brighter colors when the background is dark, and vice versa.
- Customizing the colors was quite difficult. Users would have to modify colors manually
  using Beamer's `\setbeamercolor{}`, with `fg` and `bg` options set correctly. I didn't
  really have any problem with that, but it could not allow for granular control of light and
  dark themes. And more problematically, colors were linked via `use` options,
  but these do not automatically refresh if the color linked is updated, which meant that
  users would have to add multiple lines just to modify the alert color everywhere it was used.
- Color themes lived in their own files and were added via `\usecolortheme{moloch-tomorrow}` 
  etc, which was starting to feel a bit hard to manage given that we might want to eventually support
  a large variety of color themes.

The new color system now promises to fix all of these issues and is activated
via a new macro `\molochcolors{}`. In the next sections I'll try to outline how
it works. 

### Light and Dark Variants

Every color theme now supports both light and dark variants that you can switch between seamlessly:

```latex
\molochcolors{variant=light}
\molochcolors{variant=dark}
```

This can^[Even though I am not sure how much of practical value there
is to this.] even be used mid-presentation, which would technically allow
someone to switch back and forth between dark and light modes.

### Switching Themes

Switching the entire color theme can also be done easily via this new macro:

```latex
\molochcolors{theme=tomorrow}
```

Or, if you want the dark theme:

```latex
\molochcolors{theme=tomorrow, variant=dark}
```

Both this option and the variant option are aliased in the package options, so you can also set them
when loading the theme:

```latex
\usetheme[
  colortheme=tomorrow,
  colortheme variant=dark
]{moloch}
```

### Granular Color Control

The new `\molochcolors{}` command gives you granular control over individual colors in the theme.
In particular, you can set colors that apply selectively to either the light or dark variant, or to 
the currently active variant. For instance, to set colors that apply to the current variant, you can do:

```latex
\molochcolors{
  alerted text=red,
  progressbar fg=blue
}
```

Or, if you want to set colors specifically for the light variant, you can do:

```latex
\molochcolors{
  light/normal text fg=black,
  light/frametitle bg=white
}
```

These settings will be stored separately for light and dark variants, so if you switch between them later,
your customizations will persist!

As of now, the available customization options include:

- `normal text fg/bg` - Body text colors
- `frametitle fg/bg` - Frame title colors  
- `alerted text` - Alert/emphasis colors
- `example text` - Example text colors
- `progressbar fg/bg` - Progress bar colors
- `standout fg/bg` - Standout frame colors

### User-Accessible Semantic Colors

All color themes now define semantic color names
(like `mNormaltextFg`, `mAlertFg`, `mProgressbarFg`) that you can use anywhere
in your presentation:

```latex
% Use theme colors in TikZ graphics
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[fill=mAlertFg, text=mNormaltextBg] {Alert!};
\end{tikzpicture}

% Or in text
This is \textcolor{mExampleFg}{colored text} using theme colors.
```

These are updated dynamically when you switch themes or variants, so you
can rely on them to always reflect the current color scheme.
Hopefully, this will make it easy to keep your entire presentation
consistent with the chosen theme!

## New Color Themes

As a result of the redesigned color system, it is now much easier to add new
color themes. And in this release, I've added two new themes:

- Catppuccin, which is based on the popular [Catppuccin color palette](https://catppuccin.com)
- Paper, a high-contrast theme that uses black, white, greys, and a set of colors
  based on Stephen Few's book *Show Me the Numbers* [@few2004].

### Catppuccin

The Catppuccin theme brings the beautiful pastel colors of the Catppuccin palette
to Moloch presentations. It supports both light and dark variants. It uses
quite low contrasts, so it is best suited for presentations in well-lit environments
or web-based viewing.


```latex
\usetheme[colortheme=catppuccin]{moloch}
```

![Catppuccin Light](images/example-colortheme-catppuccin-light.png){.lightbox group="catppuccin"}

![Catppuccin Dark](images/example-colortheme-catppuccin-dark.png){.lightbox group="catppuccin"}

### Paper

The Paper theme is one that I have long wanted to add, but which was
difficult to implement due to the links between colors in the old system.
It is a high-contrast theme that uses black, white, and greys for the main
elements, and a set of colors inspired by Stephen Few's *Show Me the Numbers*
[@few2004] for alerts and examples. It uses the same background for the main text
as for the frame titles, which gives it a different feel compared to other themes.

```latex
\usetheme[colortheme=paper, colortheme variant=light]{moloch}
```

![Paper Light](images/example-colortheme-paper-light.png){.lightbox}

![Paper Dark](images/example-colortheme-paper-dark.png){.lightbox}

## Improved Existing Themes

I've also made a few changes to the dark variants of the existing themes to
take advantage of the new color system. In general, I do not find the use of
a white (or very light) frame title background on dark themes to be appealing,
so I have adjusted these to use the same background color as the main text area
or a slightly darker shade.

### Default Theme

I generally try to be more conservative with changes to the default theme, but
I've changed the alert and example colors to be slightly brighter in the dark variant,
and also made the frame title background slightly darker to avoid the stark contrast.

![Default Dark](images/example-colortheme-default-dark.png){.lightbox}

### Tomorrow Theme

In the Tomorrow theme, I've made the frame title of the dark variant almost
black, which I find looks better than the previous very light grey. The colors
for alerts and examples have also been replaced with other colors from the
[Tomorrow color palette](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme).

![Tomorrow Light](images/example-colortheme-tomorrow-light.png){.lightbox}

![Tomorrow Dark](images/example-colortheme-tomorrow-dark.png){.lightbox}

### High Contrast Theme

Because the High Contrast theme is supposed to be high contrast, I've kept the
white frame title background in the dark variant, but I've adjusted the alert
and example colors to be brighter versions of the original colors.

## New Documentation Website

The Moloch documentation is now available as
both a PDF manual and an **interactive website at
[moloch.ink](https://moloch.ink)**. Even if PDF documentation seems natural
for LaTeX packages, I've long felt that it is cumbersome to navigate,
especially since users often have to scroll through many pages to find what they need
and search functionality is limited compared to a website. Not to mention
that PDFs are not exactly mobile-friendly.

I've been meaning to set this up for a while, but haven't really figured out
a good way to do it. Much of the documentation for the implementation details
of Moloch is written inside the `.dtx` files, which is great for
keeping the documentation close to the code, but not so great for building
a website.

I realized, however, that I could just keep the documentation in LaTeX syntax
there, and just have [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) convert it to
Markdown, which can then be used as source files for a Quarto website, which
I can thereafter render into both HTML and PDF^[Yes, I know this
turns it into LaTeX once again, which might feel backwards, but
starting to write markdown inside the `.dtx` documents seemed like a too big
change, at least for now.] formats.

The documentation is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org), which means:

- **Always up-to-date**: Documentation is generated directly from the theme's source code
- **Interactive examples**: Live code samples you can copy and modify
- **Searchable**: Find what you need quickly
- **Beautiful presentation**: Clean, modern interface with syntax highlighting
- **Accessible anywhere**: Read on any device without downloading PDFs

The PDF manual is still available for offline reading, but the website offers a much better browsing experience with its table of contents, search functionality, and responsive design.

## Refined Itemized List Styling

In version 1.1.0, Moloch introduced a refreshed list styling
that used new symbols for itemize environments. Instead of
using filled circle, circle, smaller circle, I switched to
filled circle, filled square, and filled triangle, which I found
to be more visually distinct and appealing.

![The new and old itemize environments.](images/itemize-redesign-v1-1-0.png){.lightbox}

However, there were still some issues with the design^[See [this comment](https://github.com/jolars/moloch/pull/50#issuecomment-3403850799) 
for instance.]. In particular, the triangle and circles I used
were based on math fonts, which sometimes led to inconsistent sizing
and alignment issues that could depend on the compiler and font setup.

Therefore in this release, the symbols are now all drawn using TikZ (or PGF primitives, to be precise),
which ensures consistent sizing and alignment across different setups.

## Increased Line Widths for the Progress Bar

The progress bars for Moloch (at section pages by default), have had quite a 
thin line width^[This is configurable via the `progressbar linewidth` option, but
the default value was quite low.] that was often hard to see. So in this
release, I've increased it from `0.4pt` to `1.0pt`, which should make it
more visible without being too obtrusive. I hope that most users will
find this change beneficial, and know that you can otherwise
easily customize it to your liking:

```latex
\molochset{progressbar linewidth=0.4pt}
```

The above line would restore the previous thin line width if desired.

The title separator line on the title page was also increased, but only marginally from 
`0.4pt` to `0.5pt`, given that it has only decorative purpose, but I am
considering increasing it further in a future release.

## Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from an earlier version of Moloch, here are the key changes
to be aware of:

### Color Options

The old `background=dark` option is deprecated. Use the new variant system instead:

```latex
% Old (deprecated)
\usetheme[background=dark]{moloch}

% New
\usetheme[colortheme variant=dark]{moloch}
```

### Color Theme

Enabling the tomorrow theme and high contrast theme is now done via the `colortheme` option:

```latex
% Old
\usecolortheme{moloch-tomorrow}
% New
\usetheme[colortheme=tomorrow]{moloch}
```

The use of `\usecolortheme{moloch-highcontrast}` is still supported for
backward compatibility, but it is recommended to switch to the new method.

## Getting Started

Moloch 2.0.0 is available on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/moloch) and will be
