  We have a new paper out on arXiv about normalization for

  regression). There is remarkably little research on
  how to standardize non-normal features in regularized
  regression and in this paper we try to bridge

:::


The lasso is probably the most well-known regularization method and the first
one I encountered when I first learned about regularized regression methods.
The model can be written as a special case of the elastic net,
which is an optimization problem that takes the following form:
$$
  \operatorname*{minimize}_{\beta_0 \in \mathbb{R},\bm{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^p}
  \frac{1}{2} \lVert \bm y - \beta_0 - \bm{X}\bm{\beta} \rVert^2_2  +
  \lambda_1 \lVert \bm\beta \rVert_1 + \frac{\lambda_2}{2}\lVert \bm \beta \rVert_2^2,
$$
where $\bm{X}$ is the matrix of features, $\bm{y}$ is the response, and
$\beta_0$ and $\bm{\beta}$ are the intercept and coefficients, respectively.
Setting $\lambda_2 = 0$ gives us the lasso, whereas $\lambda_1 = 0$
gives us ridge regression: another special case of the elastic net.

In the equation above, 
$$
\lambda_1 \lVert \bm\beta \rVert_1 + \frac{\lambda_2}{2}\lVert \bm \beta \rVert_2^2
$$
is a *regularization term* that penalizes coefficients by their magnitudes,
and $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ control the strength of this penalization.
The higher these are set, the more the coefficients are shrunk towards zero.
A high enough value of $\lambda_1$ will make some or all the coefficients zero, which
gives us a *sparse* model. This is the primary reason why the lasso has been
so popular, since this sparsity leads to a model that is easier to interpret.

## Normalization

Like most people who have been introduced to the lasso, I quickly learned that
you need to normalize the features ($\bm{X}$) before fitting the model since 
their scales affect the resulting coefficients. The larger the scale
(as measured in variance or, equivalently, standard deviation), the smaller the
effect of regularization becomes. The reason for this is that the coefficient
can be smaller for an equivalent effect on the predicted response.

Many sources, including one of the first papers on the lasso by
@tibshiraniRegressionShrinkageSelection1996, recommend that you *standardize*
your data, which means centering and scaling each feature by its mean and
standard deviation. If your features are normally distributed, this practice
speaks to intuition: each feature's distribution can be described fully by its
mean and standard deviation, so standardizing it will create a standard normal
distribution, ensuring that the effects of regularization will be fair across
the full set of features. After having standardized, most people
will eventually want to return the coefficients to the original scales of the
features, but doing so is simple.

The problem with the procedure, however, is that not all features are normally
distributed. What, for instance, should we do about binary features?^[Features
that values in $\{0,1\}$ only as, for instance, whether or not you have a
specific gene present in your DNA.] At this point you may wonder if this
matters in practice, and the answer is that it does. Consider
@fig-realdata-paths, which shows the lasso paths for four different data sets
and under two types of normalization schemes: standardization and max--abs
normalization. The latter of these scales the data to lie in $[-1, 1],$ which
preserves sparsity for binary data but makes it sensitive to outliers.

![Lasso paths for some real data sets. Notice that 
the paths differ heavily depending on which normalization type
(standardization or max--abs) is used. The first five 
features to be selected in either normalization scheme
are colored in the plots.](images/realdata-paths.svg){#fig-realdata-paths width="500px"}

The point of this figure is to illustrate that the choice of normalization
matters in a critical way, leading to different models and 
affecting the conclusions you draw from it. 

## The (Non-Existent) Literature

Remarkably, this (strong) relationship between normalization
and regularization has not been studied at all. When
searching for motivation for whatever normalization approach
a given paper used, I typically found that papers either just
stated their method of normalization as a matter of fact or
motivated it by being "standard". 

To me, this seems fine if you're just researching simulated data that you've
sampled from some normal distribution. But that's rarely the case when dealing
with real data, and never so when the data is binary. There are some more
informal discussions on normalization, however, so I'd like to take some time
to briefly review these here. For instance, the [current documentation for
scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#scaling-sparse-data)
recommends users to use `MaxAbsScaler` (max--abs normalization) to deal with
sparse data (in order to preserve sparsity), but there is no discussion on the
fact that this will affect the model (as we saw in @fig-realdata-paths). My
feeling about this is that I would be very careful before I based my choice of
normalization (and, implicitly, the choice of model) on the way the data is
stored on my hard drive (sparse or dense), particularly since it is often
simple to normalize the data during optimization without having to ever store
the full matrix in a dense format. This is for instance what
[glmnet](https://glmnet.stanford.edu) does, which, on the other hand, only
supports a single type of normalization (standardization).

[In a comment to an issue for the **ncvreg**
package](https://github.com/pbreheny/ncvreg/issues/18#issuecomment-689496385),
Patrick Breheny, the author of said package, writes that you should definitely
standardize dummy features. Finally, [there is also a question on stack
exchange about
this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/69568/whether-to-rescale-indicator-binary-dummy-predictors-for-lasso),
but no real conclusions to be drawn from it.

In spite of all this, lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression have been used
frequently on binary data in spite of there being very little understanding of
how these methods actually work in this situation.

## The Paper

The paper that we have written about this is titled *The Choice of
Normalization Influences Shrinkage in Regularized Regression* [@larsson2025] and is
now [out on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03821)^[You can see 
an abstract and citation info [here](/publications/normreg/) as well]. In it, we begin to address this
apparent knowledge gap by studying this interplay between normalization and
regularization in lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. Our focus is on the
case of binary features and mixes of binary and normally distributed
features.

Our first result is that the class balance (proportion of ones versus zeros^[Or
equivalently, its mean.]) of the binary feature directly influences
shrinkage. For both ridge and the lasso, the effect is basically that the more
imbalanced the feature is, the more the coefficient will be shrunk by the
estimator. Note that this effect is a by-product of regularization and does not, for instance,
occur with standard linear regression. 

Interestingly, this effect from a given normalization scheme depends directly
on which regularization method is used, which means that to mitigate this
effect you will need different normalization strategies depending on which type
of penalty we use in our model. 

To study this more formally, we introduce a parameterization for scaling
a feature, given by
$$
  s_j = (q_j - q_j^2)^\delta,
$$
where $q_j$ is the class balance of the $j$th feature. When
$\delta = 0$, there would for instance be no scaling for the binary feature (as
in max--abs normalization). If $\delta = 1/2$, we would scale by the
*standard deviation* of the feature---as in standardization. If $\delta = 1$,
then we would instead scale by its variance.

Throughout the paper we assume that our data comes from a linear model
$$ 
\bm{y} = \bm{X\beta} + \bm{\varepsilon},
$$
where $\bm{y}$ is the response, $\bm{X}$ is the matrix of features,
and $\bm{\varepsilon}$ is the vector of errors, which we 
assume to be identically and independently distributed and,
for many of our results, normally distributed.

These are classical and mostly non-controversial assumptions in this field. But
we also make a strong^[Although the assumption is strong, our empirical
experiments suggest that our results likely extend to more general cases.]
assumption, assuming that the features are orthogonal to one another, so that
$\bm{X}^\intercal \bm{X}$ is some diagonal matrix. In this case, the elastic
net estimator admits a closed-form expression, which means that we can study
the effect of varying the scaling parameter $\delta$.

## Bias--Variance Trade-Offs

What we show in our paper is that there is a bias--variance trade-off with
respect to this normalization parameter, $\delta$. See @fig-mixed-data for
a simple example of this, where we consider a two-dimensional
problem with one binary feature and one normally distributed feature.
We have kept the true coefficients fixed at one for each of the
features, and only vary $q$: the class balance (proportion of ones and zeros in the 
binary feature). We consider the cases $\delta=0$ (no scaling), $\delta=1$ (standard
deviation scaling), and $\delta=1$ (variance scaling) and we see that there
are only two settings that seem to mitigate this class-balance bias:
in ridge and lasso regression, respectively, these are $\delta = 1/2$ and $1$.

with standard deviation 1/2, ($\operatorname{Normal}(0, 0.5)$).

This figure also shows that this type of variance scaling,
while *reducing* bias, *increases* variance in the estimates. This
is not particularly surprising, however, since an unbalanced feature
necessarily provides less information than a balanced one.

@fig-mixed-data is purely an empirical result from a simulation,
but under our particular assumptions we can work out this
bias--variance trade-off exactly. In @fig-biasvar-lasso, we
have done exactly that for the lasso. (The paper includes results for
ridge regression and the elastic net as well.) In this figure, $\sigma_\varepsilon$
represents the standard deviation of the error term in our
data---the measurement noise. And what we can deduce from this
figure is that this bias--variance trade-off very much depends on the 
noise level. If the signal is strong, then we can reduce the
mean-squared error (MSE) by employing this variance scaling,
but if the problem is noisier, we do better (in a prediction error
sense) by using standardization instead.

To study if and how this choice of the normalization parameter $\delta$ might
impact predictive performance in a real-data setting, we've also conducted
experiments where we have varied both $\delta$ as well as the regularization
strength ($\lambda$) for lasso and ridge models, recording hold-out error for
each fit. The results are shown in @fig-hyperopt, from which it is evident that
the optimal value for $\delta$ is data-dependent, although standardization
might make for a good default since it mitigates some of the class-balance
bias without imposing too much variance.

$\lambda/\lambda_\text{max}$ (where $\lambda_\text{max}$ is the
value at which all the coefficients are zero).

## Mixed Data

We spend a substantial amount of time in the paper to also discuss the problem
of mixed data: data sets that include both binary and continuous features,
although in the paper we restrict ourselves to study the case of normal
features.

When dealing with regularized methods, this scenario imposes a tricky question,
namely: how do we put binary and continuous features on the same scale? This
question is critical because, as we have already seen, shrinkage from the lasso
and company will depend directly on how we choose to normalize the features to
deal with this.

To put this problem into perspective, let's say that we standardize *all* our
features and also assume that our binary features are *perfectly balanced* (so
that $q_j = 1/2$ for all $j$ corresponding to a binary features). If all of
this holds, then it actually turns out that the coefficients of the binary and
normal features will be regularized by the same amount if flipping the binary
feature from 0 to 1 corresponds to a change of one standard deviation in the
normal feature. In other words, our choice of normalization imposes this
particular choice of what a one-unit change in terms of a binary feature should
be equivalent to in terms of a normal feature (or vice versa).

You may or may not think this is a reasonable approach to scale binary and
normal features relative to one another, but I would be surprised if you
thought that this was reasonable for *all* binary features, given that they
often represent entirely different things. Some features are indeed truly
binary in nature, but many are just too distant points on the same continuum.
It is true that some binary features come from dichotomization of continuous
variables, in which case you should be able to base your choice of scaling on
the original continuous feature's scale, but even in this case it is not the
case that there is one single way to dichotomize a variable that ensures that
they are put on the same scale.^[In any case, you should always be careful
about dichotomizing your features since you are in effect throwing away
information about your data.]

The particular relative scaling imposed by standardization was actually the
subject of a paper by @gelman2008, although tackled from the perspective of
presenting standardized coefficients in standard regression model settings. In
this paper, he argues that the default of equating a one-unit change in a
binary feature to a one-standard deviation change in the normal feature is
typically *not* a good default and advocated for instead using
*two* standard deviations. In our paper, we adopt this setting, but
here I want to stress that there is nothing critical in our results that
depend on this. But we want to stress that this choice should if
possible be done actively.

Another interesting part about this is that if we switch normalization method
to, say, maximum--absolute value normalization, then this relationship
changes.^[Even if the binary features are perfectly balanced.] With another
normalization method comes another relative scaling of binary and normal
features. So, the choice of normalization does not just lead to a different
behavior with respect to class balance, it also leads to an implicit
weighting of binary and normal features relative to one another.

## The Weighted Elastic Net

We have so far discussed the normalization in the context of the lasso and
ridge regression. Careful readers might, however, have noticed that we have not
yet said anything about the elastic net (save for a few words in the
introduction). The reason is that it turns out to me impossible to 
fully mitigate the class-balance
bias in the case of the elastic net through modifications
to the normalization procedure, which you can almost guess from @fig-mixed-data,
since the modifications for ridge and lasso are different.

Thankfully there turns out to be a solution to this problem, which is to use
the *weighted elastic net*, in which we modify the weights of each
penalty factor instead of normalizing. The problem
then becomes
$$
  \frac{1}{2} \lVert \bm{y} - \beta_0 - \bm{X}\bm{\beta}\rVert_2^2 + \lambda_1 \sum_{j=1}^p u_j |\beta_j| + \frac{\lambda_2}{2} \sum_{j=1}^p v_j \beta_j^2.
$$
I won't cover any details here, but please see the paper for more information.

## Summary

The main takeaway from this paper is that the choice of normalization
matters greatly in the case of regularized regression, at least in
the case of lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. In spite of this
fact, there is scant research on this topic, and the little information
that is available through non-formal channels is typically anecdotal
and not motivated by any theoretical or even empirical considerations.

We have focused on binary features in this paper and have shown that standard
approaches such as standardization and max--abs normalization lead to biased
estimates in terms of class balance (the proportion of ones) of these binary
features, depending on whether a lasso or ridge penalty is used. I think this
may come as a surprise to some and have real implications for data sets in
which a given feature is rare but has a strong effect on the response.
Consider, for instance, gene expression data where the presence of a rare gene
might be crucial for predicting a disease. If you would apply the lasso this
data set after having standardized it, then chances are that your model might
not pick up on this effect at all.

I have covered a few highlights in this blog post, but there is
much more in the paper itself, including a section on normalization
in the case of interactions between the features as well as
many more experiments (and of course much more theory).
I think you'll find the paper interesting and hope that it might
be able to spur some future research on this topic, which is surprisingly
understudied.
