I am very happy to have just heard that my thesis was selected for the 2025
CramÃ©r Prize for best thesis in statistics defended in 2024! The thesis is
about optimization and algorithms for sparse regression and I have previously
written about it in a [blog post here](/blog/2024-05-22-phd-thesis/) so I will
not delve into details. But I am tremendously happy to have received this
prize and want to thank my supervisors and committee for the prize.

The [CramÃ©r Society](https://statistikframjandet.se/cramersallskapet/start/) is
a branch of the Swedish statistical society^[StatistikfrÃ¤mjandet]. Each year
they award a prize for the best PhD thesis in statistics (or mathematical
statistics) defended in Sweden. The prize is named after Harald CramÃ©r, a
Swedish mathematician and statistician who made fundamental contributions to
probability theory and statistics. He was a professor at Stockholm University
from 1929 to 1958 and is particularly known for his work on mathematical
statistics and probability theory.

The announcement can be found [here](https://statistikframjandet.se/cramersallskapet/cramerpriset-2025-gar-till-johan-larsson/)
but it is in Swedish, but I have translated it here:

> The CramÃ©r Prize is awarded annually for the best doctoral thesis to a person
> who defended their PhD in statistics/mathematical statistics during the past
> calendar year. This year, the prize goes to Johan Larsson, who defended his
> thesis at the Department of Statistics at Lund University. The motivation for
> the decision reads as follows:
> 
> In his thesis "Optimization and algorithms in sparse regression", Johan Larsson
> tackles challenges that typically arise in the analysis of datasets with a
> large number of predictors and relatively few observations. The thesis thereby
> addresses problems that are central to contemporary statistical learning.
> Through the development of prescreening methods and optimization algorithms,
> Johan improves regression modeling using established regularization methods,
> such as LASSO and SLOPE, in high-dimensional contexts. The thesis, which
> contains both theoretical and applied parts, is very well written and, in
> addition to the developed statistical methods, also contributes software
> intended for objective comparison of different optimization methods.
