It seems that I am on a lucky streak! I was also just^[Used to be correct
when I started drafting this post, but now it's been a little more than a month actually.] awarded
Lund School of Economics's award for best thesis in 2024.

You can read the news post
[here](https://www.lusem.lu.se/article/lusems-best-thesis-award-2024-goes-johan-larsson),
in which I answer some questions regarding the thesis.

Here is the nomination:

> In his dissertation, Johan Larsson develops new algorithms and optimization
> methods for sparse regression—a methodology used when the number of
> predictors is large relative to the number of observations. Special emphasis
> is placed on regularization methods, which introduce a penalty on model
> complexity to reduce the risk of overfitting. This is crucial in statistics
> and machine learning, where models with many variables often risk capturing
> random noise rather than meaningful signals. Regularization helps identify
> the most important variables, much like finding a needle in a haystack,
> making theoretical models more applicable to real-world data. The
> dissertation introduces new algorithms for sparse regression, where many
> predictors can be excluded without losing essential relationships, with a
> particular focus on regularization methods such as LASSO and SLOPE.

Again, I want to thank LUSEM and all of the people who helped me on the way.
