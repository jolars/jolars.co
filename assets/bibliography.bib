                 situations with a large number of predictors with
                 possibly high correlations, such as gene expression
                 data. In this article, a new method called the OSCAR
                 (octagonal shrinkage and clustering algorithm for
                 regression) is proposed to simultaneously select
                 variables while grouping them into predictive clusters.
                 In addition to improving prediction accuracy and
                 interpretation, these resulting groups can then be
                 investigated further to discover what contributes to
                 the group having a similar behavior. The technique is
                 based on penalized least squares with a geometrically
                 intuitive penalty function that shrinks some
                 coefficients to exactly zero. Additionally, this
                 penalty yields exact equality of some coefficients,
                 encouraging correlated predictors that have a similar
                 effect on the response to form predictive clusters
                 represented by a single coefficient. The proposed
                 procedure is shown to compare favorably to the existing
                 shrinkage and variable selection techniques in terms of
                 both prediction error and model complexity, while
                 yielding the additional grouping information.",

                 non-zero coefficients in the true linear model) are
                 fixed, Yuan and Lin (2007) give a necessary and
                 sufficient condition for the Elastic Net to
                 consistently select the true model. They showed that it
                 consistently selects the true model if and only if
                 there exist suitable sequences λ1 (n) and λ2 (n) that
                 satisfy EIC (which is defined later in the paper). Here
                 we study the general case when p, q, and n all go to
                 infinity. For general scalings of p, q, and n, when
                 gaussian noise is assumed, sufficient conditions are
                 given such that EIC guarantees the Elastic Net's model

                 performance of the Elastic Net with that of the Lasso.
                 Through theoretical results find simulation studies, we
                 provide insights into when the Elastic Net can
                 consistently select the true model even when the Lasso

                 deteriorating gait and vestibular asymmetry, which has
                 proved predictive of falls in the elderly. To date,
                 research on this coupling remains inconclusive and has
                 not focused specifically on fallers. In the present
                 study, differences in gait variability were examined in
                 a population of elderly females with fall-related wrist
                 fractures, divided into samples with positive (N=28,
                 73±9 years) and negative head-shaking tests (N=6,
                 67±9 years). Swing, stance, and double support time
                 variability were measured in preferred speed walking
                 using GAITRite(®) and statistically evaluated in
                 multivariate analysis of covariance with age as
                 covariate. Results showed overall greater gait
                 variability for the positive nystagmus group (p=0.03)
                 despite non-significant adjustment of the covariate
                 (p=0.18). In post-hoc analysis, the effect on
                 variability in double support time emerged as a
                 significant and large contributor to this difference
                 (p=0.009, ηp(2)=0.20). Conversely, the ability of
                 swing and stance time variability to discriminate
                 between groups was both non-significant and small
                 (p=0.25, ηp(2)=0.04 and p=0.34, ηp(2)=0.03
                 respectively). We believe that the increased
                 variability might stem from a strategic use of double
                 support to re-stabilize from balance perturbations
                 during gait. To some extent, these results diverge from
                 previous findings and need to be reassessed in future

                 efficacy of exercise as treatment for patients with
                 persistent neck pain. Development of new treatment
                 strategies is warranted, especially on methods that
                 could lead to lasting reductions in pain, disability,
                 and improvements in function. Objective: In a
                 collaboration between the Department of Pain
                 Rehabilitation at Skåne University Hospital and the
                 two orofacial pain departments of Umeå and Malmö
                 University, we have developed a supervised exercise
                 intervention program aimed at alleviating pain,
                 disability, and improving self-efficacy in patients
                 with persistent neck pain. Methods: Patients with
                 persistent neck pain undergoing rehabilitation at the
                 Physiotherapy Program at the Department of Pain
                 Rehabilitation, Skåne University Hospital will receive
                 a supervised, structured program of exercises
                 addressing postural control and functions of the neck,
                 jaw, and shoulders – all of which will feature
                 structured progressions. The exercise program will
                 complement the customized therapy that all patients
                 currently receive. The intervention is in part based on
                 an ongoing project in Umeå for patients with
                 jaw-related pain, which has resulted in positive
                 outcomes for, not only jaw pain, but also neck pain. In
                 the present project, the program has been extended and
                 optimized for patients with persistent neck pain.
                 Results The gym was designed in 2015 and the pilot
                 study started in May 2016. After evaluation of the
                 pilot study, necessary adjustments will be carried out
                 before the main study commences (planned to start in
                 2017). The preliminary results have so far have been
                 promising. Conclusions: The SMIL gym is a supervised
                 and structured exercise program for patients with
                 persistent neck pain. Patients will exercise in a
                 gym-like environment under supervision of trained
                 physiotherapists to promote individualized and
                 sustainable progression.",

  abstract     = "Vestibular asymmetry is a common cause of dizziness in
                 the elderly, for whom it precipitates the risk of
                 falling. Previous studies have shown that those with
                 vestibular asymmetry displayed an altered variability
                 in double support time (DST) compared to controls.
                 However, swing time (SwT) variability findings are
                 conflicting. In this study, we investigated if
                 vestibular asymmetry might be causally connected to
                 increased DST variability. We studied a group of eight
                 elderly fallers with wrist fractures across three
                 months, during which time four of them regained
                 vestibular symmetry while four others developed an
                 asymmetry. We evaluated the variability of DST and SwT,
                 both when the participants suffered from vestibular
                 asymmetry and when they did not. On average,
                 variability in DST was significantly greater by
                 2.38~\%CV (coefficient of variation) when participants
                 scored positive for vestibular asymmetry compared to
                 when not, t(5) = 4.39, p = 0.01, ξ = 1.67. In
                 contrast, SwT variability differed non-significantly by
                 0.44~\%CV when participants had tested positive versus
                 negative for vestibular asymmetry, t(5) = −0.87, p =
                 0.39, ξ = −0.29. As a possible rationale for our
                 results, we propose that increased DST variability may
                 be the result of a re-stabilization strategy. Further
                 research on DST variability and its correlation to the
                 duration of vestibular asymmetry is recommended.",

  abstract     = "AIM OF INVESTIGATION: Those who fail to recover from
                 whiplash traumas risk persistent, widespread pain.
                 Women and those whose trauma was long ago may be
                 particularly prone to develop such symptoms, but
                 research on the topic is so far scant. We aimed to
                 assess whether age, gender, or time since trauma was
                 related to widespread pain. METHODS: 746 patients with
                 persistent pain after whiplash traumas were recruited,
                 and included based on reported trauma and ICD-10 codes
                 M53.0, M53.1, S13.4, or T91.8A. The exclusion criterion
                 was major neurodegenerative diseases, which excluded
                 one person. Pain distribution was diagnosed clinically
                 as widespread, regional, or local. A multinomial logit
                 was fit to the data, predicting pain distribution from
                 age, gender, and time since trauma. RESULTS: The model
                 fit was significant Chi-2(3) = 37.8, p {$<$} 0.0001
                 Women were 1.595 [CI: 1.138; 2.232] times more likely
                 to be diagnosed with widespread than local pain p {$<$}
                 0.000, and 2.710 [CI: 1.656; 4.425] times more prone to
                 have widespread compared with regional pain p = 0.027.
                 Every month passed since the trauma increased the risk
                 for widespread pain with 1.003 [CI: 1.001; 1.006] times
                 compared with local pain, p = 0.027, and 1.005 times
                 [CI: 1.001; 1.009] compared with regional pain, p =
                 0.011. Age did not account for any significant
                 differences. CONCLUSION: Time elapsed since the trauma
                 correlated with widespread pain---a novel finding. In
                 our discussion we provide a rationale for this, along
                 with the increased risk of being a woman, which
                 confirms the results of previous studies.",

                 for data involving sets and relationships thereof.
                 Compared to Venn diagrams, Euler diagrams do not
                 require all set relationships to be present and may
                 therefore be area-proportional also with subset or
                 disjoint relationships in the input. Most Euler
                 diagrams use circles, but circles do not always support
                 accurate diagrams. A promising alternative for Euler
                 diagrams is ellipses, which enable accurate diagrams
                 for a wider range of set combinations. Ellipses,
                 however, have not yet been implemented for more than
                 three sets or three-set diagrams where there are
                 disjoint or subset relationships. The aim of this
                 thesis is to present a method and software for
                 elliptical Euler diagrams for any number of sets. In
                 this thesis, we provide and outline an R-based
                 implementation called eulerr. It fits Euler diagrams
                 using numerical optimization and exact-area algorithms
                 through two steps: first, an initial layout is formed
                 using the sets' pairwise relationships; second, this
                 layout is finalized taking all the sets' intersections
                 into account. Finally, we compare eulerr with other
                 software implementations of Euler diagrams and show
                 that the package is overall both more consistent and
                 accurate as well as faster for up to seven sets
                 compared to the other R-packages. eulerr perfectly
                 reproduces samples of circular Euler diagrams as well
                 as three-set diagrams with ellipses, but performs
                 suboptimally with elliptical diagrams of more than
                 three sets. eulerr also outperforms the other software
                 tested in this thesis in fitting Euler diagrams to set
                 configurations that might lack exact solutions provided
                 that we use ellipses; eulerr's circular diagrams,
                 meanwhile, fit better on all accounts save for the
                 diagError metric in the case of three-set diagrams.",

                 therapy-related randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
                 across the world. PEDro was searched for RCTs in
                 physical therapy published between January 1 2015 and
                 December 5 2016. For each trial, the first and last
                 authors’ affiliations and the PEDro scale were
                 extracted. Using the first and last authors’
                 affiliations, each article was geocoded using the Data
                 Science Toolkit API. The search located 2,959 RCTs,
                 which were affiliated primarily with a small cluster of
                 countries. The median PEDro score for all trials was 5
                 (IQR 4:7). The geographical spread of the RCTs was
                 focused around Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia,
                 Oceania, the United States, and parts of South America.
                 The lack of diversity might be problematic for the

                 aimed to investigatethe impact of age, gender, and type
                 of trauma on pain distribution in patients with

                 gender, type of trauma, and pain distribution were
                 collected from the medical records of 745 consecutive
                 patients with persistent pain after whiplash trauma
                 from 2010 to 2014. The data had beenrecorded in a
                 prospective manner according to a pre-established
                 checklist. Paindistribution was diagnosed clinically in

                 previous study of acute whiplash trauma in the same
                 geographic area from 2007 and 2008. Results: Age and
                 type of trauma did not seem to affect the
                 paindistribution. However a shift in age and gender
                 distribution wasobserved from the acute to the chronic

                 Widespread pain is common in patients who do notrecover
                 after whiplash trauma. Females were overrepresented in

                 43\% widespread, 48\% regional, and 9\% local, and
                 corresponding figures among males were 29\%, 53\%, and
                 18\%. Longer time between trauma and assessment did not
                 affect pain distribution among the men, but a tendency
                 towards more widespread pain was observed among the
                 women. Discussion: The importance of {"}female sex{"}
                 as risk factor for the development of persistent pain
                 after neck trauma needs to be discussed further. The
                 high frequency of regional and widespread pain among
                 patients with persistent neck pain after trauma calls
                 for both multidisciplinary assessments and treatment
                 strategies. The relationships between different pain
                 distribution patterns, disability, activity, and
                 psychological factors need to be studied further.",

                 sine function or sinc function, denoted by sinc(x), has
                 two slightly different definitions. In mathematics, the
                 historical unnormalized sinc function is defined for x
                 ≠ 0 by sinc ⁡ ( x ) = sin ⁡ ( x ) x .

                 operatorname \{sinc\} (x)=\{\textbackslash frac
                 \{\textbackslash sin(x)\}\{x\}\}\textasciitilde.\} In
                 digital signal processing and information theory, the
                 normalized sinc function is commonly defined for x ≠
                 0 by sinc ⁡ ( x ) = sin ⁡ ( π x ) π x .
                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash
                 operatorname \{sinc\} (x)=\{\textbackslash frac
                 \{\textbackslash sin(\textbackslash pi
                 x)\}\{\textbackslash pi x\}\}\textasciitilde.\} In
                 either case, the value at x = 0 is defined to be the
                 limiting value sinc(0) = 1. The normalization causes
                 the definite integral of the function over the real
                 numbers to equal 1 (whereas the same integral of the
                 unnormalized sinc function has a value of π). As a
                 further useful property, all of the zeros of the
                 normalized sinc function are integer values of x. The
                 normalized sinc function is the Fourier transform of
                 the rectangular function with no scaling. It is used in
                 the concept of reconstructing a continuous bandlimited
                 signal from uniformly spaced samples of that signal.
                 The only difference between the two definitions is in
                 the scaling of the independent variable (the x-axis) by
                 a factor of π. In both cases, the value of the
                 function at the removable singularity at zero is
                 understood to be the limit value 1. The sinc function
                 is then analytic everywhere and hence an entire
                 function. The term {"}sinc{"} /ˈsɪŋk/ is a
                 contraction of the function's full Latin name, the
                 sinus cardinalis (cardinal sine). It was introduced by
                 Phillip M. Woodward in his 1952 paper {"}Information
                 theory and inverse probability in telecommunication{"},
                 in which he said the function {"}occurs so often in
                 Fourier analysis and its applications that it does seem
                 to merit some notation of its own{"}, and his 1953 book
