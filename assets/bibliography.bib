    Interpretation of regression coefficients is sensitive to the scale of the inputs. One method
    often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its
    standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard
    deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean \pm{}1 standard
    deviation. The resulting coefficients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary
    predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with
    two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the
    National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of
    rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option--an
    improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in
    the data file--so that the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of
    routine statistical practice. Copyright q 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

    Regularized models are often sensitive to the scales of the features in the data and it has
    therefore become standard practice to normalize (center and scale) the features before fitting
    the model. But there are many different ways to normalize the features and the choice may have
    dramatic effects on the resulting model. In spite of this, there has so far been no research on
    this topic. In this paper, we begin to bridge this knowledge gap by studying normalization in
    the context of lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. We focus on normal and binary features
    and show that the class balances of binary features directly influences the regression
    coefficients and that this effect depends on the combination of normalization and
    regularization methods used. We demonstrate that this effect can be mitigated by scaling binary
    features with their variance in the case of the lasso and standard deviation in the case of
    ridge regression, but that this comes at the cost of increased variance. For the elastic net,
    we show that scaling the penalty weights, rather than the features, can achieve the same
    effect. Finally, we also tackle mixes of binary and normal features as well as interactions and
    provide some initial results on how to normalize features in these cases.
